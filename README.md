Single-page application for tracking beach volleyball tournament results.
Focus on great UX and simplicity.

I used React JS, HTML, CSS, Material UI, NPM, Git. Deployed on Namecheap.
• Player input forms
• Tournament schedule generation based on player count.
• Game score input forms. Possibility to edit after submitting.
• Total wins and points calculation for every player.
• Tournament winner calculation.
• Simple bottom navigation bar - hidden/visible when necessary.
• Results download possibility by using htmlToImage package on npm.
• Dynamic download file names are generated based on current time.
• Alerts when necessary.
• Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics implemented.
• Used localStorage to prevent loss of data in case of accidental reload of the page.
